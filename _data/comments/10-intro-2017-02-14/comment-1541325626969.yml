message: "Today, I went to the beachfront with my children. I found a sea shell and gave it to my 4 year \r\nold daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She placed the shell to her ear \r\nand screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear.\r\n\r\nShe never wants to go back! LoL I know this is entirely off \r\ntopic but I had to tell someone!"
