message: "Howdy just wanted to give you a quick heads up. The text \r\nin your post seem to be running off the screen in Opera. I'm not sure if this is a formatting issue or something to do with web browser compatibility but I thought \r\nI'd post to let you know. The design and style look great \r\nthough! Hope you get the problem fixed soon. Many thanks"
